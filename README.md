Vaadin Flow - Integration of Google Maps Webcomponent

Could not believe how easy it is to use (well documented) WebComponents with Vaadin Flow.

In this small project I'm creating a class wrapping https://www.webcomponents.org/element/GoogleWebComponents/google-map (GoogleMap.java) and using it XGoogleMapView.java.

You need to input your own API-Key in the XGoogleMapView.java
